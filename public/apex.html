  <h1>Task Manager</h1>
  <p>A straightforward web-based tool called Task Manager assists users in managing, tracking, and organizing their daily chores.
   Task name, description, due date, status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Done, Incomplete), and priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low) are among the details that users can include when creating tasks. 
   Users of the program can examine dashboards or reports that show the progress of tasks over time, as well as add or remove tasks. 
   It's a useful tool for maintaining organization and increasing efficiency.</p>
